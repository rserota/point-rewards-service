This web service has been built with Node.js. If you don't have Node.js on your machine, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This download includes NPM, the package manager for Node.js. 

You'll need to install the project dependencies. Open a terminal at the root of this project, and run `npm install` to install the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file. 

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can run the application with `npm start`. It should run locally on port 8080. After the application has started, you can run the tests with `npm run test`.
